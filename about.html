<h1>About me:</h1>

<p>
    The bravest thing I've ever done was give a product demonstration to a live audience of over one thousand people.
My role model is my dad because he immigrated to Canada when he was only 18, got a job right away, and worked hard to provide for our family.
I have worked in marketing for over half my life.
I have travelled to over 30 countries for business. My favourite one was Japan because they have a lot of delicious food.
The first time I ever moved away from home was participating in a job internship 500 miles away from my hometown.
