            <h2>Hello this is sarath!</h2>
            <p><i>“I’ve been in the industry for 8 years, and my journey has been quite exciting. 

                I started my career as a software engineer and gradually transitioned into product management.
                
                I’m currently overseeing a project that involves launching a new cloud-based collaboration tool for our remote teams. 
                
                It’s been a rewarding experience navigating the challenges and collaborating with cross-functional teams to ensure its success. One aspect I find particularly interesting is ensuring seamless integration with existing workflows while enhancing user experience.</i></p>

            
                <strong>I am good!</strong>
            <h3>Short intro:</h3>
           <p></p> I’m not here to talk Salinger or the writing life or the greats of 20th century American literature. This is a marketing blog, not a book club.

I am, however, going to talk about introductions, and how to write them well.

We hear a great deal of talk about the importance of headlines, but much less is said about the value of a great introduction. Sure, you need a tempting headline to catch your reader’s eye, but without a strong, compelling introduction, the best headline ever written won’t save you.</p>
